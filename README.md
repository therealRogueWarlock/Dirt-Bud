## What is this app?

The MotocrossPal is the new and innovative tool, for everything Motocross. This app will help you manage your own Dirtbikes, keeping track of the lifetime of your parts as well as help you improve the situation in your garage. This app will help you keep track of all your parts, both installed and spare, as well as help you with a in-app toolbox keeping your tools stored.

This will also help you keep note of the different dates you work on your Dirtbike, and let you write down the specifics of what you have done, such as Oil Change, New Chain, or maybe just an entirely redo of the Fork

## Requirements

* [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see information about my garage, so I can see my different dirt bikes

* [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see information about myself, so I can track my fitness stats

* [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see information about dirt bike status, so I know when different parts might need to be checked upon or changed out

* [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see all my different bike parts, so I can keep track of in use, and spare parts

* [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see specifications about individual parts, so I do not need to remember details about every single part

* [ ] As a user, I want to be able to add friends, so I can share my repertoire of overly expensive parts to brag about
